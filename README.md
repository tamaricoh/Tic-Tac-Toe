# Tic-Tac-Toe game

## **A simple tic-tac-toe game**

### What

This is my first project in which I combined work with CSS, HTML and JS, which I learned by myself.

I wanted to design and build a project that would include listening to user's actions.

### How

In order to run this project, all you need is to open those three file in VS Code and run the HTML file with Live Server (if Life Server is installed on your VS Code).
